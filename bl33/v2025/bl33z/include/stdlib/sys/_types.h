/*
 * rune_t is declared to be an ``int'' instead of the more natural
 * ``unsigned long'' or ``long''.  Two things are happening here.  It is not
 * unsigned so that EOF (-1) can be naturally assigned to it and used.  Also,
 * it looks like 10646 will be a 31 bit standard.  This means that if your
 * ints cannot hold 32 bits, you will be in trouble.  The reason an int was
 * chosen over a long is that the is*() and to*() routines take ints (says
 * ANSI C), but they use __ct_rune_t instead of int.
 *
 * NOTE: rune_t is not covered by ANSI nor other standards, and should not
 * be instantiated outside of lib/libc/locale.  Use wchar_t.  wchar_t and
 * rune_t must be the same type.  Also, wint_t must be no narrower than
 * wchar_t, and should be able to hold all members of the largest
 * character set plus one extra value (WEOF), and must be at least 16 bits.
